The opening mission
We meet an artificer halfling - "Arty"
- smell: Burning wood
- curly brown hair
- Skiddish

We are in the "Tree Scraper" in a forested city. Trees seems to be more of buildings on this planet.
The look of the bark on this tree is wider, it does not seem to take up any less space, there is a clearing of flowers
around the 
-- This is a specific "strong" tree
-- The tree is tough, the fire did not affect the tree

There are pirates in the area
The pirates are looking for Ascal the tree artificer for some reason

DD&D says that the artifacts are the reason we are here, DD&D has said that no pirate can leave with an artifact.

The pirates are old tech orc/hobgoblinss that mainly exist in dead-magic zones.
